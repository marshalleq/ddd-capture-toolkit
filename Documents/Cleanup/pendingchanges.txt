PENDING CROSS-PLATFORM CHANGES - REQUIRES CAREFUL REVIEW
========================================================

This file tracks changes to critical calibration, alignment, and validation code
that need manual review before implementation to avoid breaking the working system.

STATUS: All safe changes completed. The following files have been identified as
requiring careful review due to their critical nature:

CRITICAL FILES REQUIRING MANUAL REVIEW:
======================================

1. ddd_clockgen_sync.py (MAIN CAPTURE/CALIBRATION SCRIPT) ✅ COMPLETED
   - Lines 962, 1067: subprocess calls updated to sys.executable
   - Line 130: shebang line (safe, no change needed)
   - TESTING: Dependencies check passes, ready for capture testing
   - RISK: Breaking capture workflow or alignment calculations
   - STATUS: Updated and committed to critical-subprocess-updates branch

2. tools/audio-sync/vhs_audio_align.py (AUDIO ALIGNMENT) ✅ SAFE AS-IS
   - Line 1: shebang only (safe, no change needed)
   - No subprocess calls with python3 found
   - STATUS: No changes required

3. tools/timecode-generator/vhs_timecode_analyzer.py (VALIDATION) ✅ SAFE AS-IS
   - Line 1: shebang, Line 12: usage comment (both safe)
   - No subprocess calls with python3 found
   - STATUS: No changes required

4. tools/timecode-generator/shared_timecode_robust.py (CORE TIMING) ✅ SAFE AS-IS
   - Line 1: shebang only (safe, no change needed)
   - STATUS: No changes required

5. tools/validate_mp4_timecode*.py (VALIDATION TOOLS) ✅ SAFE AS-IS
   - Only shebang lines found, no subprocess calls with python3
   - STATUS: No changes required

6. Debug/Analysis Tools (LOWER PRIORITY)
   - debug_*.py files: Can be updated after core functionality verified
   - analyze_*.py files: Can be updated after core functionality verified
   - These are less critical but still be cautious

SAFE CHANGES COMPLETED:
======================
✓ All shebang lines (#!/usr/bin/env python3) - safe, just interpreter location
✓ check_dependencies.py - Updated to use sys.executable
✓ platform_utils.py - Updated to use sys.executable
✓ ddd_main_menu.py - Updated non-critical subprocess calls (menu operations)
✓ tools/audio_alignment_analyzer.py - Updated usage instructions
✓ Menu and UI scripts
✓ Setup and configuration scripts
✓ Documentation references

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Test current system functionality thoroughly
2. Review each critical file individually
3. Test changes on development branch first
4. Consider making changes incrementally, testing after each

NOTES:
======
- The platform_utils.py module is ready and safe to use
- All infrastructure for cross-platform support is in place
- Only the actual command calls in critical files need updating
- Most changes are just python3 -> sys.executable (very safe)
- But some files may have more complex platform-specific logic

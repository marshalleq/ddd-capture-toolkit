DOMESDAY DUPLICATOR CAPTURE SYSTEM - AUDIO OVERRUN PROBLEM & SOLUTIONS
=======================================================================
Session Date: 2025-08-06
Problem: SOX audio buffer overruns during long VHS captures
Status: Multiple solutions implemented and tested - ready for post-reboot testing

=== ORIGINAL PROBLEM SUMMARY ===
SOX audio overruns occurring at ~16+ minutes during VHS captures:
- CXADC+ADC-ClockGen USB audio device (78.125kHz/24-bit)
- Error: "sox WARN alsa: overrun occurred" 
- Buffer underflow also reported by DomesdayDuplicator
- USB device running at full speed (USB 1.1) causing bandwidth constraints

=== ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED ===
1. USB POWER MANAGEMENT: Device autosuspend causing buffer interruptions
2. SMALL AUDIO BUFFERS: Default ALSA buffers (~20ms) insufficient for high sample rates
3. INCORRECT ALSA PLUGIN: Initial dmix config was for playback, not capture
4. BASIC SOX CONFIGURATION: Using hw:2,0 without buffer optimization
5. I/O BOTTLENECKS: High write loads (~1.5GB/s) during capture

=== SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED (ALL PERSISTENT) ===

1. USB POWER MANAGEMENT FIX
   File: /etc/udev/rules.d/50-domesday-duplicator-power.rules
   Content: ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="16c0", ATTR{idProduct}=="0fb0", ATTR{power/autosuspend}="-1"
   Effect: Disables USB autosuspend for DomesdayDuplicator hardware
   Applied: Automatically on boot via udev

2. ALSA AUDIO BUFFER ENHANCEMENT 
   File: ~/.asoundrc
   Plugin: dsnoop (correct for input capture, not dmix)
   Buffer size: 16384 frames (~210ms at 78.125kHz) - was ~20ms
   Period size: 4096 frames (~52ms at 78.125kHz)
   Effect: 10x larger audio buffers with proper capture plugin
   Applied: Automatically when ALSA loads

3. SOX COMMAND OPTIMIZATION
   File: ddd_clockgen_sync.py (get_sox_command function)
   Device: Changed from 'hw:2,0' to 'cxadc_buffered'
   Buffer: Added '-B', '8192' SOX internal buffer parameter
   Effect: Multi-layered buffering approach
   Applied: Code changes are permanent

4. AUDIO DELAY CONFIGURATION
   File: config.json
   Setting: "audio_delay": 0.8 (0.800s for A/V synchronization)
   Effect: Prevents timing drift during long captures
   Applied: Read by script on every run

=== VERIFICATION COMMANDS POST-REBOOT ===

Test ALSA configuration works:
  sox -t alsa cxadc_buffered -n trim 0 0.1
  (Should show: 78125Hz, 24-bit, 2 channels, no errors)

Check USB power management active:
  cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/power/autosuspend | grep -v "2000"
  (Should show "-1" for DomesdayDuplicator device)

Verify configuration files present:
  ls -la /etc/udev/rules.d/*domesday*
  ls -la ~/.asoundrc
  cat config.json

=== TECHNICAL DETAILS ===

Before (problematic):
- ALSA buffers: ~20ms (insufficient)
- USB power: Autosuspend enabled (interruptions)
- SOX device: hw:2,0 (basic hardware access)
- Plugin type: dmix (wrong - playback only)
- Overruns: At 16+ minutes consistently

After (should be fixed):
- ALSA buffers: ~210ms (10x larger)
- USB power: Autosuspend disabled (no interruptions) 
- SOX device: cxadc_buffered (optimized with large buffers)
- Plugin type: dsnoop (correct - input capture)
- SOX internal buffer: 8192 samples additional protection
- Multi-layered buffering: Hardware → ALSA → SOX → System I/O

=== EXPECTED RESULTS ===

Buffer protection layers now active:
1. Hardware USB buffer (managed by USB controller)
2. ALSA driver buffer: 210ms (was ~20ms)
3. SOX internal buffer: 8192 samples 
4. System I/O buffers: NVMe is excellent (Seagate FireCuda 520)

Overruns should be eliminated or greatly reduced due to 10x larger buffers.

=== SYSTEM SPECS (VERIFIED GOOD) ===
- OS: Fedora Linux
- Storage: NVMe Seagate FireCuda 520 (excellent performance)
- USB Audio: CXADC+ADC-ClockGen (card 2, device 0)
- TRIM: Enabled and running weekly
- Memory: Large dirty byte buffers (good for write performance)
- I/O: No storage bottlenecks identified

=== TROUBLESHOOTING IF OVERRUNS PERSIST ===

1. Verify all configuration files are correct and loaded
2. Test ALSA device: sox -t alsa cxadc_buffered -n trim 0 0.1
3. Check USB power management is active
4. Consider increasing buffers further (up to ~500ms possible)
5. Investigate real-time process scheduling
6. Monitor system load during capture

=== FILES CHANGED/CREATED ===

Persistent system files:
  /etc/udev/rules.d/50-domesday-duplicator-power.rules (new)
  ~/.asoundrc (new)
  config.json (updated audio_delay)
  ddd_clockgen_sync.py (updated SOX command)

Backup files:
  remember_original.txt.bak (original project notes)

=== NEXT STEPS AFTER REBOOT ===

1. Verify ALSA configuration: sox -t alsa cxadc_buffered -n trim 0 0.1
2. Test short capture to ensure no immediate errors  
3. Run long capture (20+ minutes) to verify overruns resolved
4. Monitor capture logs for any remaining issues
5. Fine-tune if needed (unlikely with 210ms buffers)

=== STATUS ===
All solutions implemented and persistent across reboots.
System should work significantly better immediately after reboot.
Multiple layers of buffer protection now active.
Original project workflow preserved in remember_original.txt.bak.
